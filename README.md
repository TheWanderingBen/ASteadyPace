# A Steady Pace
The first repository for A Steady Pace — a Unity project for me to learn Technical Art. Please feel free to follow along with this repository to track progress of A Steady Pace.

## What the Heck is A Steady Pace?
A Steady Pace is really a concept: that you can continue to learn throughout your life — no matter your expertise level in a subject, or your age, or your time or commitments. If you timebox small sessions of a few hours, you'll be able to master things soon enough!

For this particular project, I'm leveling up my Technical Art skills. This is the repository for these experiments — starting with a hiking scene!

## What is Technical Art?
Good question! Very broadly, I think of Technical Art as anything that uses mathematics to make pretty things in game engines. Think about taking a 3D model of a blade of grass, and using that to create rolling green hills whose flora blows in the breeze.

Note that "in game engines" means I'm building on top of a lot of stuff done for me — I won't be directly making window managers or doing view frustrum transforms or writing OBJ importers; that's a bit more low-level than we're looking at, something for Rendering Engineers to worry about. Similarly, I won't be doing complex modeling or rigging or animating or texturing; that's more Arist work that is less about the math behind the visuals.

Of course I may end up dabbling a bit in these areas. It'll be hard to do much without a basic model, texture, or sprite; and probably some of our exploration will butt up against core rendering pipelines. But for the most part, I want to focus on the algorithms generating pretty things. That's what I'm excited to learn!

## Who is Ben Wander?
I'm a game developer who first started as a designer in mobile games back in 2009. I've since jumped through AAA games, at studios like BioWare and Visceral Games, and landed in the indie space — 1/4 founder of The Wandering Band.

I also teach the Game Development Capstone at the University of Denver in (surprise!) Denver, Colorado — which I now call home!

You might be thinking that someone like me probably knows a lot about Technical Art already, but I'm pretty novice! There are so many facets to game development, from game systems to UX to writing, and it happens that my focus has never fallen on Technical Art. But the field has always fascinated me, so now I'm finally trying to master this broad area!

## What Software Are You Using?
The first version uses Unity 2019 LTS (2019.4.3f1) with HDRP 7.4.3. I'll update as we go along, especially with LTS versions and HDRP versions. If necessary, I'll go off of LTS versions, though right now I feel that I'd like to stick to those if possible.

## Will You Always Use Unity?
For this repository, yes. I do want to try Unreal, just to learn some basics everywhere. But I'm most familiar with Unity, and as I always tell my students: use what you're comfortable with to achieve your end goals! I'm just learning tech art, so let's start here.
